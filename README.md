# 5EChargen

This python code was originally writen by ChatGPT, my plan is to extend the code to include all the races and classes in the Players Handbook.

Changes:

3/30/2023 - Added some logic to choose a Class based on the higher attributes rolled. The code defaults to Commoner if no reasonable class can be selected.

3/15/2023 - added classes, races and backgrounds. I also updated the ability score generator.
