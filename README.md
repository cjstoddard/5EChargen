# 5EChargen

This python code was originally writen by ChatGPT, my plan is to extend the code to include all the races and classes in the Players Handbook.

Changes:

3/30/2023 - Added some logic to choose a Class based on the higher attributes rolled. The code defaults to Commoner if no reasonable class can be selected. Changing minimum_score from 15 to 13 will produce less Commoner characters, but will increase the number of characters whose class does not match the highest attribute rolled; ie a Fighter with a Strength of 14 and an Intelligence of 17.

3/15/2023 - added classes, races and backgrounds. I also updated the ability score generator.
